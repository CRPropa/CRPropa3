These tables contain the data for the background flux and associated optical depths of gamma rays for the WMAP5+Fixed ('fixed') and Evolving Dust ('fiducial') models presented in Gilmore, Somerville, Primack, and Dominguez (2012), ArXiv:1104.0671v2

EBL Flux tables (101 rows by 21 columns): the first column is rest frame wavelength in angstroms, and the following columns are the proper flux at the redshifts listed in the header, with units of <erg sec^{-1} cm^{-2} ang^{-1} sr^{-1}>.

Optical depth tables (101 rows by 58 columns):  The first column is OBSERVED gamma-ray energy in MeV, and the following 57 columns are optical depth (tau) for sources at the redshifts indicated in the header.  Recall that attenuation = e^{-tau}.  Some entries are set to 10^10; this just reflects the fact that these redshifts are higher than those for which we are able to obtain emissivity results with our modeling techniques.
