The energy densities for our "model C" are here. This model uses a fit to the star formation data in Hopkins & Beacom (2006) using a parameterization from Cole et al. (2001) and a Baldry & Glazebrook (2003) IMF. The first column is the photon energy in eV, and the second column is the comoving energy density in erg cm-3. Each file is for a different redshift, with the redshift (z) in the name of the file.
