There are, however, an increasing number of studies that have found that there are two algorithms, which work in general best for propagating charged particles within a magnetic field. These two algorithms are compared and evaluated.\n",

For the simplest case of a homogeneous background field, the particle trajectory can be derived analytically. This enables comparison with numerical integrators and provides information on the errors of the algorithms for the corresponding parameters being used. The aim is to find a relationship between the error and the parameters applied. The pitch angle and the step length are suitable parameters to determine the influence. \n",
