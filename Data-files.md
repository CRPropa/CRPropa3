The data tarball contains the tabulated interaction rates and other tabulated data for CRPropa.
The default tarball is automatically downloaded during the build process. In case you want to use a different photodisintegration model use the link to the alternative tarballs below and extract them to your install folder. 

**Default data file:** https://crpropa.desy.de/images/2/2e/Data_2016_03_21_TALYS.tar.gz  
Uses photodisintegration cross sections (for A > 12) from TALYS 1.6 with a partially modified set of GDR parameters.

**Alternative 1:** https://crpropa.desy.de/images/d/d3/Data_2016_03_21_Kossov.tar.gz  
Uses total photodisintegration cross sections from Kossov together with the branching ratios from TALYS.

**Alternative 2:** https://crpropa.desy.de/images/0/0a/Data_2016_03_21_PSB.tar.gz  
Uses the PSB photodisintegration model.
