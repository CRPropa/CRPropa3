CRPropa is a publicly available simulation framework to study the propagation
of ultra-high-energy nuclei up to iron on their voyage through an
(extra)galactic environment. It takes into account: pion production,
photodisintegration and energy losses by pair production of all relevant
isotopes in the ambient low-energy photon fields as well as nuclear decay.
CRPropa can model the deflection in (inter)galactic magnetic fields, the
propagation of secondary electromagnetic cascades and neutrinos for a multitude
of scenarios for different source distributions and magnetic environments. It
enables the user to predict the spectra of UHECR (and of their secondaries),
their composition and arrival direction distribution. Additionally, the
low-energy Galactic propagation can be simulated by solving the transport
equation using stochastic differential equations. CRPropa features a very
flexible simulation setup with python steering and shared-memory
parallelization.
