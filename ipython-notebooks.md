The tutorials are tracked in the project CRPropa3-notebooks.
For the wiki the notebooks are statically rendered with the notebook viewer on http://nbviewer.ipython.org/.

To add a new notebook to the list of tutorials:

1. Push the new notebook to the CRPropa3-notebooks repository
2. Append the link to the raw notebook file to http://nbviewer.ipython.org/
For the [basics](https://github.com/CRPropa/CRPropa3-notebooks/blob/master/basics/basics.ipynb) notebook the link would be http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/CRPropa/CRPropa3-notebooks/blob/master/basics/basics.ipynb
3. Paste the link on the wiki
