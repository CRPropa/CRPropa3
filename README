Installation from source
------------------------
MPC is configured using CMAKE - for more information see www.cmake.org
1) $cd build
2) $cmake .. (or $ccmake ..)
3) $make
4) $make test (to run all unit tests)
5) Set the data path MPC_DATA_PATH=[path to mpc/data]
6) Retrieve additional data files from https://forge.physik.rwth-aachen.de/projects/mpc/files
	The photo-disintegration tables PDtable_XXX.txt have to be copied to mpc/data/PhotoDisintegration 

Notes for Intel Compiler:
  -DCMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS="-lifcore" -DCMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=ifort


Dependencies
------------
Required:
C++ Compiler
Fortran Compiler 
	-> to compile SOPHIA

Provided:
SOPHIA 
	-> for photo-hadronic interactions
googletest
	-> for unit-tests

Optional:
Python and SWIG
	-> to use MPC from Python
	tested for > Python 2.7
	tested for > SWIG 2.0
FFTW3F 
	-> for turbulent magnetic field grids
	MPC needs the FFTW3 library compiled with the single precision option 
Gadget 
	-> for large scale structure using the smooth particle formalism
OpenMP
	-> for shared memory parallelization
googleperftools 
	-> for performance optimizations regarding shared memory parallelization
